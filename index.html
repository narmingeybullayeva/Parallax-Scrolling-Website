              <h3>Autumn</h3>
              <p>
                Autumn is the season after summer and before winter. In the United
                States and Canada, this season is also called fall. In the Northern
                Hemisphere, it is often said to begin with the autumnal equinox in
                September and end with the winter solstice in December. In the Southern
                Hemisphere, it runs from the autumnal equinox in March to the winter
                solstice in June.
              </p>
              <h3 class="small__heading">Nature in the Autumn Season</h3>
              <p>
                In many places in the temperate zone, autumn is a time for harvesting
                most crops. Deciduous trees (trees that lose their leaves every year)
                lose their leaves, usually after turning yellow, red, or brown. In many
                countries, autumn is the time a new school year starts. The period of
                school between the start of September and the end of December is often
                referred to as the "Fall Semester", "Fall Quarter", or "Fall Term".
              </p>
              <p>
                When it is autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, it is spring in the
                Southern Hemisphere. When it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, it is
                spring in the Northern Hemisphere. On the Equator, autumn is very much
                like spring, with little difference in temperature or in weather. Autumn
                is a time when most animals are looking for food so they can store up
                for winter, because they soon will be going into hibernation. The
                weather gets colder and more windy. In Autumn the hours of daylight and
                the hours of night are the same. In autumn the weather changes all the
                time. The weather turns cooler and often windy and rainy.
